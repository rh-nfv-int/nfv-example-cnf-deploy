No maintenance on this repository. 
See the updated version of ====> [example-cnf roles HERE](https://github.com/redhatci/ansible-collection-redhatci-ocp/blob/main/roles/example_cnf_deploy/README.md).

## Prerequisites

OpenShift 4 Cluster should be deployed with  additional operators:
 * SR-IOV operator should be deployed and necessary resources for
   `SriovNetworkNodePolicy` and `SriovNetwork` should be created with
   target namespace (default namespace used to deploy example cnf
   is `example-cnf`).

 * Performance Addon operator should be deployed and a `PerformanceProfile`
   should be created.

## Application Version

The versions of the different parts of example-cnf (trex-app, trex-server, testpmd containers...) are dynamically extracted from the nfv-example-cnf-catalog. To run properly some tests, make sure you are using a dedicated catalog containing the versions fo the images you want to test.


## Deploy

```
K8S_AUTH_KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig ansible-playbook create.yaml --extra-vars @quay-repo-v2.yaml
```

### Other Deploy Options

```

In order to deploy for cluster6, add an additional parameter
```
K8S_AUTH_KUBECONFIG=../kubeconfig ansible-playbook create.yaml -e cluster_name=cluster6
```
